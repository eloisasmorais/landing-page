This README has the intention of outlining some of the project details

## Project decisions

This project was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript, I used the mobile-first approach and prioritized layout simplicity for mobile while creating a more interactive version on desktop, I added a few simple animations to make the landing page more interesting on big screens.

### What could be improved:

- Image sizes: some images on the landing page are still loading very slowly, I used TINYPNG to make file sizes smaller but it didn't work much with some of them.
- Remove event listener from the window after the animations are loaded.
- Use of git to track changes to the project, since this is a small project I didn't bother using git to manage the project's file but it could be useful if more people were working on this as well.
